</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>What is Python?</td>
<td>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and versatility. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What are some key features of Python?</td>
<td>Key features of Python include dynamic typing, automatic memory management (garbage collection), a vast standard library, support for modules and packages, and an interactive mode.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What is PEP 8 and why is it important?</td>
<td>PEP 8 is the Python Enhancement Proposal that outlines the style guide for Python code. It is important because it promotes consistency and readability in Python code, making it easier for programmers to collaborate and understand each other&#39;s work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Explain the differences between lists and tuples in Python.</td>
<td>Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their elements after creation, and are defined by square brackets []. Tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their content cannot change, and are defined by parentheses ().</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What are Python decorators?</td>
<td>Decorators in Python are functions that modify the behavior of another function. They are often used to add functionality to existing code in a clean and reusable way. You define a decorator function and apply it to another function using the &#39;@decorator_name&#39; syntax.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What is the purpose of the <strong>init</strong> method in a Python class?</td>
<td>The <strong>init</strong> method is a special method in Python, known as the constructor, that is automatically called when an object of the class is created. It initializes the object&#39;s attributes and sets up any necessary state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What are Python modules?</td>
<td>Modules in Python are files containing Python code that can define functions, classes, and variables. They allow for code organization and reusability. Modules can be imported into other Python programs using the &#39;import&#39; statement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>How does exception handling work in Python?</td>
<td>Exception handling in Python is done using &#39;try&#39;, &#39;except&#39;, &#39;else&#39;, and &#39;finally&#39; blocks. Code within the &#39;try&#39; block is executed, and if an exception occurs, control is transferred to the &#39;except&#39; block. &#39;else&#39; runs if no exceptions occur, and &#39;finally&#39; executes regardless of whether an exception occurred.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy?</td>
<td>A shallow copy of an object creates a new object but inserts references into it to the objects found in the original. A deep copy creates a new object and recursively adds copies of nested objects found in the original, making it independent of the source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What are list comprehensions in Python?</td>
<td>List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. They consist of brackets containing an expression followed by a &#39;for&#39; clause, and can include additional &#39;if&#39; clauses to filter items. For example: [x**2 for x in range(10)] produces a list of squares from 0 to 9.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Explain what a lambda function is in Python.</td>
<td>A lambda function is an anonymous function expressed as a single statement. It can take any number of arguments but has only one expression. The syntax is &#39;lambda arguments: expression&#39;. Lambda functions are often used for short-term use in functional programming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python?</td>
<td>The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecode at once. This can be a limitation in CPU-bound multi-threaded programs but simplifies memory management.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Describe what a Python generator is.</td>
<td>A generator is a special type of iterator that yields values one at a time and maintains its state between each yield. Generators are defined using the &#39;yield&#39; keyword and are more memory efficient than functions that return a list because values are produced on-the-fly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What are the built-in data types in Python?</td>
<td>Built-in data types in Python include: 1. Numeric: int, float, complex 2. Sequence: list, tuple, range 3. Text: str 4. Binary: bytes, bytearray, memoryview 5. Set: set, frozenset 6. Mapping: dict 7. Boolean: bool 8. NoneType: None.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What is the purpose of the &#39;with&#39; statement in Python?</td>
<td>The &#39;with&#39; statement in Python simplifies exception handling by encapsulating common preparation and cleanup tasks in so-called context managers. It is commonly used with file operations to ensure proper resource management.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What is the difference between &#39;==&#39; and &#39;is&#39; in Python?</td>
<td>In Python, &#39;==&#39; checks for value equality, meaning it considers two objects equal if they have the same value. &#39;is&#39; checks for reference equality, meaning it checks if two variables point to the same object in memory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What are some common built-in exceptions in Python?</td>
<td>Common built-in exceptions in Python include: 1. ValueError: Raised when a function receives an argument of the right type but inappropriate value. 2. TypeError: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type. 3. IndexError: Raised when trying to access an element from a list with an out-of-range index. 4. KeyError: Raised when trying to access a dictionary with a key that does not exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What are some uses of the &#39;pass&#39; statement in Python?</td>
<td>&#39;pass&#39; is a null operation statement that is often used as a placeholder in functions, conditionals, or loops, where syntactically some code is required but you want to leave it empty for future implementation or to indicate &#39;do nothing&#39;.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What is Python?</td>
<td>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. Key benefits include a large standard library, community support, and cross-platform compatibility.</td>

| What is a dynamically typed language?                                                                                                                                                                                              | A dynamically typed language is one in which the type of a variable is determined at runtime rather than at compile-time. This allows for more flexibility, as variables can be reassigned to different data types without causing errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| What is an interpreted language?                                                                                                                                                                                                   | An interpreted language is one that is executed line-by-line by an interpreter rather than being compiled into machine code prior to execution. This allows for easier debugging and dynamic execution of code but can result in slower performance compared to compiled languages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

It is important because it promotes consistency and readability in Python code, making it easier for developers to collaborate and understand each other&#39;s work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| What is Scope in Python?                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Scope in Python refers to the area of the program where a variable is accessible. There are four types of scope:</li>
<li>Local Scope: Variables defined within a function.</li>
<li>Enclosing Scope: Variables in the enclosing function or outer function.</li>
<li>Global Scope: Variables defined at the top-level of a script.</li>
<li>Built-in Scope: Names pre-assigned in the built-in names module.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| What are lists and tuples? What is the key difference between the two?                                                                                                                                                             | Lists and tuples are both data structures in Python used to store collections of items:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed after creation (e.g., items can be added or removed).</li>
<li>Tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be altered after being created.
Key difference: Mutability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| What is the difference between Python Arrays and lists?                                                                                                                                                                            | Python Arrays are part of the array module and can only hold items of the same data type, which makes them more efficient for numerical data as they use less memory. Lists, on the other hand, are part of the built-in types and can hold items of different data types, making them more flexible but less efficient for numerical computations.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| How is memory managed in Python?                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Memory management in Python is handled by the Python memory manager, which includes private heap space for Python objects and data structures. The memory manager allocates and deallocates memory as needed, using techniques like garbage collection to reclaim memory by disposing of objects that are no longer needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| What are Python namespaces? Why are they used?                                                                                                                                                                                     | Namespaces in Python are containers that hold a collection of identifiers (names) and the corresponding objects. They prevent naming conflicts by ensuring that names in different namespaces do not interfere with each other. This allows for modularity in programming and facilitates code organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| What is Scope Resolution in Python?                                                                                                                                                                                                | Scope resolution in Python refers to the rules that determine the visibility of variables in different parts of the code. There are four scopes in Python: local, enclosing, global, and built-in. The LEGB (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in) rule dictates how names are looked up in the scope hierarchy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

If no delimiter is provided, it defaults to any whitespace character. For example, the statement &#39;Hello World&#39;.split() will result in the list [&#39;Hello&#39;, &#39;World&#39;]. The join function does the opposite; it takes a list of strings and concatenates them into one string using a specified delimiter. For example, &#39;, &#39;.join([&#39;Hello&#39;, &#39;World&#39;]) will give &#39;Hello, World&#39;.                                                            |

For example, in the list [10, 20, 30], list[-1] would return 30.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

This promotes code reusability. A child class can override methods from the parent class, as well as have its own methods. For example:
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return &#39;Animal Sound&#39;

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return &#39;Bark&#39;

This function returns a temporary object of the parent class which enables you to call its methods. For example: 
```python
class Parent:
    def show(self):
        return &#39;Parent&#39;

class Child(Parent):
    def show(self):
        return super().show() + &#39; Child&#39;
``` This would return &#39;Parent Child&#39;.                                                                                                                           |

However, by convention, it uses underscore prefixes to signify member visibility. A single underscore (e.g., _variable) indicates that it is intended for internal use, while double underscores (e.g., __variable) name-mangles the variable to avoid name clashes in subclasses.                                                                                                                                                  |

Instead, method overriding occurs when a child class defines a method with the same name as one in its parent class. The child class method will be called instead of the parent class method when invoked on an instance of the child class. There is no equivalent concept of &#39;new&#39; modifiers as seen in some languages.                                                                                                                   |

However, this is not very common because it can lead to unintended behavior due to Python&#39;s garbage collection. Finalize is intended for operations needed just before an object&#39;s memory is reclaimed, but usage is discouraged in favor of context managers (with statements) for managing resources.                                                                                                                                       |

The values can be a list, array, or a computed result based on existing columns, and it should match the length of the DataFrame.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| How will you delete indices, rows, and columns from a DataFrame?                                                                                                                                                                   | To delete indices, rows, or columns from a pandas DataFrame, you can use the `drop` method. For example, to delete a row, you would use `df.drop(index, inplace=True)`, where &#39;index&#39; is the label of the row. To delete a column, you would use `df.drop(&#39;column_name&#39;, axis=1, inplace=True)`. The `inplace` parameter, if set to `True`, modifies the DataFrame directly; if set to `False`, it returns a new DataFrame without the specified rows/columns.                                                                                          |

When the scope of an object ends, the lifecycle of that namespace also ends. This means that once a function call is complete (for local namespaces), or the global script execution ends, the corresponding namespaces are no longer accessible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Python follows the LEGB rule for name resolution: Local -&gt; Enclosing (non-local) -&gt; Global -&gt; Built-in. This hierarchy allows Python to look for names in nested scopes before moving to higher scopes.                                                                                                                                                                                      |

1. **Local**: Names defined within the current function.
2. **Enclosing**: Names in the scope of enclosing functions (for nested functions).
3. **Global**: Names defined at the top level of a module or imported from other modules.
4. **Built-in**: Names that are pre-defined in Python (like `print()`, `len()`, etc.). This order determines where Python looks for names when they are referenced.                                                                                    |

| Provide an example of using the global keyword in Python. What does it do?                                                                                                                                                         | Example:

temp = 10 # global variable

def func():
    global temp
    temp = 20 # modifies the global variable

func()
print(temp)

Output:
20

Here, using the global keyword allows &#39;func()&#39; to change the value of &#39;temp&#39; in the global scope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| What are some common functions that have the same name in different Python modules?                                                                                                                                                | Some common functions that have the same name in different modules include:
1. log10 (in both math and cmath modules)
2. acos (in both math and cmath modules)
3. exp (in both math and cmath modules).

To resolve the ambiguity when calling these functions, you prefix them with the respective module name, e.g., math.log10 or cmath.log10.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Explain the importance of prefixing module names when using functions with the same name.                                                                                                                                          | Prefixing module names is important to avoid ambiguity and ensure that the correct function is called. In Python, if two modules have functions with the same name, you need to use the module name as a namespace to clarify which function you intend to access, which helps prevent unexpected behavior in your code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
